No SQL for this one — answer in a sentence or two.

Q:
users and products are both standalone tables so far, with no orders table yet in the picture. 
Once orders exists (next lesson), which column in users would a foreign key in orders most likely point to, and why does that column make a good primary key in the first place?

A:
The `id` key in the users table would be the best choice because the `id` key is an unique and not null value.
The `user_id` column in the `orders` table hints that it will be joined to the `id` column in the `user` table.
The `email` column is not an ideal choice considering the possibility that it might be changed over time.
